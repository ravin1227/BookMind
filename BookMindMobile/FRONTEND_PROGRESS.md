## 🚀 Current Status

**Metro Bundler**: ✅ Running on http://localhost:8082
**TypeScript**: ✅ Fully configured with strict mode
**Navigation**: ✅ Working authentication flow
**State Management**: ✅ Auth and books stores functional
**UI Components**: ✅ Responsive design system

## 📱 Ready for Testing

### To Run the App:
1. **Start Metro**: `npm start` (already running)
2. **iOS Simulator**: `npm run ios`
3. **Android Emulator**: `npm run android`

### Demo Flow:
1. App opens to Splash screen (2 seconds)
2. Welcome screen with feature highlights
3. Login with demo credentials
4. Library screen with sample books
5. Navigate between tabs

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session):

- [ ] Add file picker for book uploads
- [ ] Create highlighting interface
- [ ] Build reading progress tracking

### Short Term:
- [ ] AI chat interface
- [ ] Advanced highlighting with colors
- [ ] Bookmark management
- [ ] Quote card generation
- [ ] Search functionality

### Medium Term:
- [ ] Connect to real backend API
- [ ] Implement offline storage
- [ ] Add push notifications

## 💡 Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Frontend-first approach**: Validate UX before backend complexity
- **Mock API**: Enables parallel development and rapid iteration
- **TypeScript**: Ensures code quality and developer experience
- **Zustand over Redux**: Simpler state management for reading app

### Performance Considerations:
- Lazy loading for large book lists
- Image caching for book covers
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Background processing for file uploads

### Ready for Backend Integration:
- API service layer is abstracted
- Easy to switch from mock to real API
- Authentication flow designed for JWT tokens
- File upload prepared for multipart requests
