        Chapter 1: The Story of the Merchant and the Genius

        There was once upon a time a merchant who possessed great wealth, in land and merchandise, as well as in ready money. He was obliged from time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs. One day, having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse, taking with him a small leather bag of biscuits and dates, because he had to pass through the desert where no food was to be got.

        He arrived without any accident at the end of his journey, and having finished his business, set out on his return. On the fourth day of his journey, the heat of the sun being very great, he turned out of his road to rest under some trees. He found there a spring of clear and running water. He dismounted, and having tied his horse to a branch of a tree, sat by the fountain, and took some biscuits and dates out of his bag. When he had finished this frugal meal he washed his face and hands in the spring.

        He had scarcely done so when there appeared before him an enormous genius, white with age, and of a fierce countenance, who addressed him in these words: Rise up, that I may kill you with this sabre, as you have killed my son.

        The merchant, as much frightened by the hideous shape of the monster as by his threatening words, answered him tremblingly: Alas! my good lord, of what crime can I be guilty towards you? I have killed no one.

        Did you not sit down when you came here? replied the genius; and did you not take dates from your bag and eat them? and as you ate them did you not throw the stones about?

        I did all that you say, answered the merchant, I cannot deny it.

        Well, replied the genius, as you threw the stones about, and my son was passing by at the time, one of them struck him in the eye and killed him; so I shall kill you in return.
